        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
        <h1>Are you ready for Christ’s return?</h1>
      </header>
      <section>
        <p>We demonstrated earlier in chapters <a href="//yahvehyireh.com/books/a-challenge-to-all-christians/05.html">five</a> &amp; <a href="//yahvehyireh.com/books/a-challenge-to-all-christians/06.html">six</a><sup class="reference"><a href="#r1" id="s1">1</a></sup> that the return of Jesus to fulfil the <q>promises made to the fathers</q> by setting up the Kingdom of God was a central theme of original Christian teaching. But over the long ages since, although it is accepted in theory, it has receded into the background, so that it has no practical effect on the lives and expectations of many individual Christians or the church as a whole.</p>
        <p>Yet the teaching of Jesus is crystal clear. He will come back – taking the world by surprise, and we need to be ready for it. It will be as sudden as on past occasions of divine intervention:</p>
        <blockquote><q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Matthew+24.38–39" class="bible jesus">For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.</q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r2" id="s2">2</a></sup> <footer>- Matthew 24.38–39</footer></blockquote>
        <p>To use another analogy, his return to earth will be as unexpected as the intrusion of a burglar: <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=1+Thessalonians+5.2" class="bible paul">For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.</q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r3" id="s3">3</a></sup> Hence, Jesus gives this advice:</p>
        <blockquote><q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Matthew+24.42–44" class="bible jesus">Watch therefore… But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.</q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r4" id="s4">4</a></sup> <footer>- Matthew 24.42–44</footer></blockquote>
        <p>Can you fit this aspect of Christ’s teaching into your daily life? Is this thought continually in the back of your mind: <q>Jesus may come today</q>?</p>
        <h3>Jesus the judge</h3>
        <p>When Jesus returns it will not be as the benign and gentle Jesus of the children’s hymn. He is coming initially as a judge – of individuals and then of the world at large. Jesus said that at his return, when the resurrection has taken place and when he <q class="bible">sits on the throne of his glory</q>, he will divide people into two classes on the basis of the life they have lived. The faithful will be directed to the right of his throne and will hear his words of approval: <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Matthew+25.34,46" class="bible jesus">Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world</q>, and be given eternal life.<sup class="reference"><a href="#r5" id="s5">5</a></sup></p>
        <p>This tribunal and the need for Christians to be prepared for it is repeatedly emphasised in the New Testament. The Apostle Paul often refers to it. <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Romans+14.10%3B2+Corinthians+5.10%3B2+Timothy+4.1" class="bible paul">For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ</q>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#r6" id="s6">6</a></sup> is just one example.</p>
        <p>And what will be the basis for acceptance at this tribunal? <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=John+14.15" class="bible jesus">If you love me keep my commands</q>, said Jesus.<sup class="reference"><a href="#r7" id="s7">7</a></sup> In his so-called <q>Sermon on the Mount</q> Jesus gives details of how he expects his followers to behave. He ends his discourse by saying that those who hear and do what he says will be like a house impregnable to flood and disaster, whilst the house of those who disregard his commands will perish.<sup class="reference"><a href="#r8" id="s8">8</a></sup> A very sobering thought.</p>
        <p>So there is no doubt that what the Christian does in this life will determine the result of that tribunal. Many other passages of Scripture clearly teach this:</p>
        <blockquote><q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=2+Corinthians+5.10" class="bible paul">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.<sup class="reference"><a href="#r9" id="s9">9</a></sup></q> <footer>- 2 Corinthians 5.10</footer></blockquote>
        <p>The final message of Jesus to his followers reaffirms this:</p>
        <blockquote><q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Revelation+22.12%3BMatthew+16.27" class="bible jesus">And behold, I am coming quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every one according to his work.</q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r10" id="s10">10</a></sup> <footer>- Revelation 22.12; Matthew 16.27</footer></blockquote>
        <p>And the <q>work</q> of each one has been recorded in a figurative book that will form the basis of the verdict:</q>
        <blockquote><q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Revelation+20.12" class="bible john">And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books.</q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r11" id="s11">11</a></sup> <footer>- Revelation 20.12</footer></blockquote>
        <p>What are the <q>works</q> that will enable our judge to accept us? Without entering into the <q>works</q> versus <q>faith</q> controversy that has beset theologians over many years, we can bring some Bible teaching to bear. Faith in what Jesus achieved is itself a <q>work</q>. In answer to a question: <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=John+6.29" class="bible"><q>What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?</q> Jesus answered and said to them, <q class="jesus">This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent.</q></q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r12" id="s12">12</a></sup></p>
        <p>Paul commended the Thessalonians for three things: their <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=1+Thessalonians+1.3" class="bible paul">work of faith, labour of love, and patience of hope.</q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r13" id="s13">13</a></sup> The Christian’s work also includes helping others: <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Hebrews+6.10" class="bible paul">For God is not unjust to forget your work and labour of love… in that you have ministered to the saints.</q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r14" id="s14">14</a></sup> Jesus is depicted as saying at his judgement seat to those who <q>will go into eternal life</q>: <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Matthew+25.46,40" class="bible jesus">Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.</q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r15" id="s15">15</a></sup> In that same chapter Jesus praises the diligent servant who had used the talents (abilities) his master had given him, and promises a reward as a result: <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Matthew+25.21,30" class="bible jesus">His lord said to him, <q>Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.</q></q> Whereas the lazy servant was <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Matthew+25.21,30" class="bible jesus">cast into… outer darkness.</a><sup class="reference"><a href="#r16" id="s16">16</a></sup></p>
        <p>It seems, therefore, that both faith and action will determine the Christian’s outcome. But overriding all will be the love and forgiveness of our judge and his earnest desire to bring his true followers into his Kingdom:</p>
        <blockquote><q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Luke+12.32" class="bible jesus">Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r17" id="s17">17</a></sup> <footer>- Luke 12.32</footer></blockquote>
        <p>Complete forgiveness will be willingly given to those who have striven to be faithful.</p>
        <h3>Judgements on an evil world</h3>
        <p>But for the world at large there are ominous Bible predictions about the return of Jesus that few Christians seem to take into consideration. Earlier we quoted from Daniel chapter 2, which describes the changeover on earth from the kingdom of men (the systems in place today) to the Kingdom of God.<sup class="reference"><a href="#r18" id="s18">18</a></sup> The kingdom of men is depicted by a huge statue, which came tumbling down in pieces when a stone struck it on its feet. Then all those fallen pieces were: <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Daniel+2.35" class="bible nebuchadnezzar">crushed together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r19" id="s19">19</a></sup> In symbol this stone is Jesus returning to earth, and the violent grinding and complete removal of the pieces graphically indicates the terrible devastation that will occur at the time. This is when the:</p>
        <blockquote><q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Daniel+2.44" class="bible daniel">God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.</q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r20" id="s20">20</a></sup><footer>- Daniel 2.44</footer></blockquote>
        <p>The New Testament confirms the violent end of human domination at the hand of the returned Jesus. Those who regard Jesus as the epitome of love and kindness see only one side of his character. The other side, shown at his return to a godless earth, is mentioned by the Apostle Paul:</p>
        <blockquote><q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=2+Thessalonians+1.7–8%3B2.8" class="bible paul">You who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ… And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming.</q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r21" id="s21">21</a></sup> <footer>- 2 Thessalonians 1.7–8; 2.8</footer></blockquote>
        <p>Similarly, the Book of Revelation chapter 19 describes the great and final Battle of Armageddon at which Jesus in symbol is seated on a white horse and: <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&amp;search=Revelation+19.15" class="bible jesus">out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should strike the nations. And he himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.</q><sup class="reference"><a href="#r22" id="s22">22</a></sup></p>
        <p>As a result, all the wicked in the world will be removed, and Christ’s reign of righteousness will spread throughout the earth, ruling over a purified and God-honouring population. This will be the Kingdom that Jesus bids us pray for.</p>
        <p>Is your view of Christianity able to accept the full import of such passages as these?</p>
