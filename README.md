# A Challenge To All Christians

A Challenge yes, but in a good way!!

This online book is designed to make you think.

It's offered as a way to get free of beliefs that you were taught were right, before you were old enough to decide for yourself.

Ideas from organised religion can be more about controlling the minds of Christians, or making big churches richer, than they are about loving God and each other, free from oppresive rites, rituals, leaders and regulation.

True Christianity is about changing yourself, being free to follow your own Bible-based conscience without judging others.

We offer this book humbly, to help you think for yourself, and find God if you are searching for Him.

If you think what you believe is from from the Bible, read on - you just might be surprised!
